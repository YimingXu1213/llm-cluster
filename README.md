    - sorted_gt: Comments were sorted by ground-truth topics before being passed into the topic extractor.
    - unsorted: Comments were randomly shuffled before being passed into the topic extractor.
    - sorted_pred_K-means: Comments were sorted by predicted clusters from K-means before being passed into the topic extractor.
    - sorted_pred_cos: Comments were sorted by cosine similarity of their embeddings to the first comment, then passed into the topic extractor.
    - sorted_pred_euc: Comments were sorted by Euclidean distance of their embeddings to the first comment, then passed into the topic extractor.
